### **define a problem that demonstrates PL/SQL Collections, Records, and GOTO statements.**






### **The problem is to create a PL/SQL program that can store and manage many related data items together. The program should be able to keep several values in one group, store different types of information about one item, and control the flow of the program using jumps when needed.**

This problem shows how **PL/SQL** can manage complex data and control the program’s flow effectively.

* **Collections** represent the ability to store and handle many pieces of similar data together. This means the program can process large amounts of information in an organized and flexible way, instead of working with one value at a time.

* **Records** show how different types of information that belong to one item can be grouped together. This helps in keeping data complete, connected, and easy to understand — like keeping all details about one thing in one place.

* **GOTO statements** demonstrate control and direction in a program. They help the program jump to a specific part when something unusual happens, such as an error, making the process more controlled and reliable.
