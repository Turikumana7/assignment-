### **define a problem that demonstrates PL/SQL Collections, Records, and GOTO statements.**



---

### **Description:**

This project shows how PL/SQL can be used to manage and organize data in a smart and flexible way.
It uses **Collections**, **Records**, and **GOTO statements** to handle data, group related information, and control how the program runs.

---

### **Purpose:**

The purpose of this project is to show how PL/SQL can store, manage, and control many types of data in one program. It helps to understand how these three main features work together to make a program more powerful and organized.

---

### **Key Concepts:**

* **Collections:** Used to store many values of the same type under one name.
* **Records:** Used to group different types of information into one unit.
* **GOTO Statements:** Used to control the program flow and handle special situations or errors.

---

### **Problem Definition:**

The problem is to design a PL/SQL program that can hold a group of related data, manage them easily, and handle unexpected cases smoothly. The program should show how Collections, Records, and GOTO statements can be combined to build an organized and reliable system.

---

### **Objectives:**

1. To demonstrate how to use Collections to store multiple values.
2. To show how to use Records to keep related data together.
3. To use GOTO statements to control the flow of the program.
4. To understand how these three concepts work together in PL/SQL.

---

### **Expected Results:**

* The program can store and manage multiple data items efficiently.
* It can keep related information in one place.
* It can control errors or move between sections using GOTO.
* It helps understand how PL/SQL organizes and controls data.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This project helps to understand the importance of data organization and control in PL/SQL. By combining **Collections**, **Records**, and **GOTO**, a program becomes more structured, clear, and reliable in handling data and unexpected situations.

Would you like me to translate this **README** into **Kinyarwanda** too?
